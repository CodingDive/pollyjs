# Quick Start

## Installation

_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._

```bash
npm install @pollyjs/core -D
```

If you want to install it with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
yarn add @pollyjs/core -D
```

## How it Works

Once instantiated, Polly will hook into native implementations (such as fetch & XHR)
via adapters to intercept any outgoing requests. Depending on its current
[mode](configuration.md#mode) as well as rules defined via the
[client-side server](server/overview.md), the request will either be replayed, recorded,
passed-through, or intercepted.

## Adapters & Persisters

Before you start using Polly, you'll need to install the necessary adapters and
persisters depending on your application/environment. Adapters provide
functionality that allows Polly to intercept requests via different sources
(e.g. XHR, fetch) while Persisters provide the functionality to read & write
recorded data.

Check out the appropriate documentation pages for each adapter and persister
for more details such as installation, usage, and available options.

_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._

```bash
npm install @pollyjs/adapter-{name} -D
npm install @pollyjs/persister-{name} -D
```

If you want to install them with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
yarn add @pollyjs/adapter-{name} -D
yarn add @pollyjs/persister-{name} -D
```

## Setup _(Browsers Only)_

In order to write to disk from the browser, Polly will make networks requests to a
local server using the [REST Persister](persisters/rest.md). If you don't want to use
the provided CLI and you have your own express server, see the
[Express Integrations](node-server/express-integrations.md) documentation on
integrating with your existing server.

Using the installed [CLI](cli/overview.md), run the [listen](cli/commands.md#listen)
command to start up the node server.

```bash
npm install @pollyjs/cli -g
polly listen
```

Optionally, Polly can persist to local storage which would not require setting up
any server integrations. See the [Local Storage Persister](persisters/local-storage.md)
documentation for more details.

## Usage

Now that you've installed and setup Polly, you're ready to fly. Lets take a
look at what an example test case would look like using Polly.

```js
import { Polly } from '@pollyjs/core';
import XHRAdapter from '@pollyjs/adapter-xhr';
import FetchAdapter from '@pollyjs/adapter-fetch';
import RESTPersister from '@pollyjs/persister-rest';

/*
  Register the adapters and persisters we want to use. This way all future
  polly instances can access them by name.
*/
Polly.register(XHRAdapter);
Polly.register(FetchAdapter);
Polly.register(RESTPersister);

describe('Netflix Homepage', function() {
  it('should be able to sign in', async function() {
    /*
      Create a new polly instance.

      Connect Polly to both fetch and XHR browser APIs. By default, it will
      record any requests that it hasn't yet seen while replaying ones it
      has already recorded.
    */
    const polly = new Polly('Sign In', {
      adapters: ['xhr', 'fetch'],
      persister: 'rest'
    });
    const { server } = polly;

    /* Intercept all Google Analytic requests and respond with a 200 */
    server
      .get('/google-analytics/*path')
      .intercept((req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));

    /* Pass-through all GET requests to /coverage */
    server.get('/coverage').passthrough();

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/login');
    await fillIn('email', 'polly@netflix.com');
    await fillIn('password', '@pollyjs');
    await submit();
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    expect(location.pathname).to.equal('/browse');

    /*
      Calling `stop` will persist requests as well as disconnect from any
      connected browser APIs (e.g. fetch or XHR).
    */
    await polly.stop();
  });
});
```

The above test case would generate the following [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/)
file which Polly will use to replay the sign-in response when the test is rerun:

## Client-Side Server

Every polly instance has a reference to a client-side server which you can leverage
to gain full control of all HTTP interactions as well as dictate how the Polly instance
should handle them.

?> __TIP:__ Check out the [Server](server/overview.md) documentation for more details and examples!

Lets take a look at how we can modify our previous test case to test against a
failed sign in attempt.

```js
import { Polly } from '@pollyjs/core';

describe('Netflix Homepage', function() {
  it('should handle a failed sign in attempt', async function() {
    const polly = new Polly('Failed Sign In', {
      adapters: ['xhr', 'fetch'],
      persister: 'rest'
    });
    const { server } = polly;

    /*
      Using the client-side server, we can intercept when a request url matches
      `/api/v1/login` and respond with the necessary status code and body to
      emulate a failed sign in attempt.
    */
    server.get('/api/v1/login').intercept((req, res) => {
      // Set the response's status code to be 401 (Unauthorized)
      res.status(401);

      // Respond with a json object containing an error message that will be shown
      res.json({
        error: {
          message: 'Incorrect username or password.'
        }
      });
    })

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/login');
    await fillIn('email', 'polly@netflix.com');
    await fillIn('password', '@pollyjs');
    await submit();
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    expect(document.querySelector('.error-message').textContent)
      .to.equal('Incorrect username or password.');

    /*
      Calling `stop` will persist requests as well as disconnect from any
      connected browser APIs (e.g. fetch or XHR).
    */
    await polly.stop();
  });
});
```
